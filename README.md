> Just a set of probably useless tools that I and my buddies have created during the summer practice.

* [mntshare.sh](./mntshare.sh) - Mount a Samba share that uses Kerberos authentication.
* [krb-astra.sh](https://gist.github.com/crt0r/fe48061c81ac17b55e208f72a27ceab2) - Enable user-agnostic Kerberos authentication in Firefox--tested with Astra Linux SE 1.6.
* [ipabakd](https://github.com/crt0r/ipabakd) - Ok, this one is **totally useless**. I was assigned to create a systemd service for FreeIPA that performs backups every 4 hours without touching crontab.
* [raid1builder](https://github.com/lxg7/raid1builder) - A script by my buddy [lxg7](https://github.com/lxg7) that allows you to migrate your linux system to a RAID 1 array--and it's tested on Astra Linux SE 1.6 too. I'm planning to create my own solution at some point.
